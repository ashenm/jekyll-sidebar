==== Links

The _Jekyll Sidebar Links_ facilitates external link placement on the navigation bar for external resources via the data file `links.yaml`.

The data file mandates the following structure; a YAML list composing of YAML associative arrays where each associative array corresponds to a single link to be placed on the navbar.

[source, yaml]
----
- url: ''      # the URL
  title: ''    # the link tile
  rel: ''      # the link type (defaults: external)
----

For instance, the _GitHub_ link placed on the navigation bar utilises the following YAML snippet.

[source, yaml]
----
- url: 'https://github.com/ashenm/jekyll-sidebar'
  title: 'github'
----

The preceding YAML snippet yields a HTML element equivalent to the following;

[source, html]
----
<a class="nav-link" rel="external" href="https://github.com/ashenm/jekyll-sidebar">github</a>
----

WARNING: The anchor tag text content of the navigation links will be transformed to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#Title_case[titlecase] and therefor the above will render _Github_ instead of _github_.

==== Sections
The _Jekyll Sidebar Sections_ serve as the basic blocks for standalone content.
The placement of a link:https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages[Jekyll Page] in the root directory will yield a section with a corresponding navbar entry.

NOTE: The navbar entry exerts the filename in the event of an undefined page title.

==== 404
The _Jekyll Sidebar_ includes a built-in link://ashenm.github.io/jekyll-sidebar/404[404] page to assist ease set-up with minimal exertion.
